# zoho-to-opencart-order-status-update
This code, which would run on the edit of a zoho sales order, uses Aftership's API to determine the status of order shipment, and then updates the order on order status on OpenCart using OpenCart's API to the determined order status.

This is written in Zoho's language, 'Deluge', but GitHub determines it as Java because they are similiar.
